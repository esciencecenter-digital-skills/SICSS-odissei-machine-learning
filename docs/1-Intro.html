<h2>What is machine learning</h2>
<p><strong>An informal definition by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel">Arthur
Samuel</a></strong> &gt; The field of study that gives computers the
ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.</p>
<p>The focus of machine learning (ML) is “learning”. A learning problem
is about learning some properties of examples (training data) and then
predicting those properties against other unseen data.</p>
<p><strong>A modern definition by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_M._Mitchell">Tom
Mitchell</a></strong> &gt; A computer program is said to learn from
experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance
measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves
with experience E.</p>
<p>Linking to the first definition, the experience E is actually the
examples or training data, task T is the learning problem, and
performance P is how well the computer program performs on task T when
giving unknown data.</p>
<p>For example, - predicting house price: - E = the historical price of
many houses - T = the task of predicting house price - P = the
performance is how exactly the program predict the house price - playing
Go: - E = the experience of playing many games of Go - T = the task of
playing Go - P = the probability that the program will win the next
Go</p>
<p><strong>The mathematical perspective:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of ML is the function <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span>: <span
class="math display"><em>y</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span></p>
<p>The learning is to apply specific algorithms (learning algorithms) to
training data to get the exact form of the function <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span>. The learned function
or model <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> can
then be used to predict property <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> for input data <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>.</p>
<p>The form of function <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> could be simple,
e.g. linear function, or complex, e.g. non-linear function.</p>

<p>Let’s treat all problems in the universe as a set. This set can be
divided to mathematical problems and other problems (e.g. love problems,
moral and ethical problems, cultural conflict problems and so on).</p>
<p>Some of mathematical problems are <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability">computable</a>, which
means it can be solved in principle by a computing machine, while the
other are not.</p>
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI</a> is a
subgroup of computable problems. It tries to make intelligent machines,
especially intelligent computer programs. It also means computability is
the limit of AI. AI cannot do everything, cannot solve the problems that
is not computable.</p>
<p>AI problems or goals include e.g problem-solving, reasoning,
planning, learning, communicating, acting, etc. There are various
algorithms that try to solve these AI problems.</p>
<p>ML is a subgroup of these AI algorithms which seek to enable machine
to learn from examples in order to make predictions based on input data.
ML is comprised of classical algorithms and deep learning (DL)
algorithms. Classical ML algorithms include, e.g. linear regression,
decision trees, support vector machine, etc.</p>
<p>Deep learning is a specific group of algorithms that are based on
artificial neural networks. “Deep” in deep learning refers to a neural
network comprised of more than three layers, which would be inclusive of
the inputs and the output.</p>

<!-- https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence -->
<p>Classical ML algorithms and DL differ in how each algorithm learns.
Deep learning automates much of the feature extraction piece of the
process, eliminating some of the manual human intervention required and
enabling the use of larger data sets. Classical machine learning is more
dependent on human intervention to learn. Human experts determine the
hierarchy of features to understand the differences between data inputs,
usually requiring more structured data to learn.</p>

<h2>Machine learning and statistics</h2>
<!-- https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4642 -->
<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#Statistics -->
<p>Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms
of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws
population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds
generalizable predictive patterns.</p>

<section id="types-of-machine-learning" class="slide level2">
<h2>Types of machine learning</h2>
<p>There are three main types of learning problems in machine learning:
supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.</p>
<h3 id="supervised-learning">Supervised learning</h3>
<p>Supervised learning describes a type of problem that enables computer
to learn a mapping between input examples and the target variable. The
training data comes with the target variable that we want to predict, we
call it labeled data.</p>
<h4 id="classification">Classification</h4>
<!-- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html#machine-learning-the-problem-setting -->
<p>As for classification, its target variable is discrete. The target
belongs to two or more classes and we want to learn from already labeled
data how to predict the class of unlabeled data.</p>
<p>An example of a classification problem would be handwritten digit
recognition, in which the aim is to assign each input vector to one of a
finite number of discrete categories.</p>
<h4 id="regression">Regression</h4>
<!-- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html#machine-learning-the-problem-setting -->
<p>Regression’s target variable is continuous. An example of a
regression problem would be the prediction of the length of a salmon as
a function of its age and weight.</p>
<h3 id="unsupervised-learning">Unsupervised learning</h3>
<!-- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html#machine-learning-the-problem-setting -->
<p>Unsupervised learning describes a type of problem that enables
computer to describe or extract relationships in data. The training data
is unlabelled data, i.e. there is no value of target variable in the
training data.</p>
<p>The goal in such problems may be - to discover groups of similar
examples within the data, where it is called
<strong>clustering</strong>, - to determine the distribution of data
within the input space, known as <strong>density estimation</strong>, -
to project the data from a high-dimensional space down to two or three
dimensions, i.e. <strong>dimensionality reduction</strong></p>
<h3 id="reinforcement-learning">Reinforcement learning</h3>
<!-- https://machinelearningmastery.com/types-of-learning-in-machine-learning/ -->
<p>Reinforcement learning describes a type of problem where an agent
operates in an environment and must learn to operate using feedback.</p>
<p>The use of an environment means that there is no fixed training
dataset, rather a goal or set of goals that an agent is required to
achieve, actions they may perform, and feedback about performance toward
the goal.</p>
<p>An example of reinforcement learning is Google’s AlphaGo.</p>
<!-- https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/machine-learning-material/blob/main/notebooks/1-Intro.ipynb -->
<p><strong>Exercise: Supervised or unsupervised</strong></p>
<p>For the following problems, do you think you need a supervised or
unsupervised approach?</p>
<ul>
<li>Find numerical representations for words in a language (word
vectors) that contain semantic information on the word</li>
<li>Determine whether a tumor is benign or malign, based on an
MRI-scan</li>
<li>Predict the age of a patient, based on an EEG-scan</li>
<li>Cluster observations of plants into groups of individuals that have
similar properties, possibly belonging to the same species</li>
<li>Your own problem and dataset</li>
</ul>

<section id="limitations-of-machine-learning" class="slide level2">
<h2>Limitations of machine learning</h2>
<!-- https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/machine-learning-novice-sklearn/01-introduction/index.html -->
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>Machine Learning requires massive data to train on. These data should
be unbiased and of good quality, which are not easy to get in
practice.</p>
<h3 id="extrapolation">Extrapolation</h3>
<p>We can only make reliable predictions about data which is in the same
range as our training data. If we try to extrapolate beyond what was
covered in the training data we’ll probably get wrong answers.</p>
<h3 id="interpretation-of-results">Interpretation of Results</h3>
<p>It’s a challenge to accurately interpret results generated by the
algorithms. You have to carefully choose the algorithms for your
purpose.</p>
