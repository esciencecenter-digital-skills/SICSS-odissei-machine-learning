# Before starting a machine learning project
## Ask yourself

:::incremental
- What is your scientific problem?
- Can this scientific problem be transformed to machine learning problem?
  - Keep the problem simple; if not, decompose it
- Do you really have to use machine learning?
:::

## Continue asking...

:::incremental
- What is the goal of your ML project?
- Do you have enough high-quality data?
- How do you measure the model performance?
  - First design and implement metrics
- Do you have good enough infrastructure?
:::

# During doing machine learning

## Data
- NEVER mix using data:
  - training data only for training
- Use common-sense features
:::


## Model
:::incremental
  - It is an iterative cycle to improve your model
:::

# After training

## Versioning
- Version your data, code and everything

## Re-train
- Retrain the model when possible
